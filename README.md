# TripleXgame
My First C++ project 

This game is part of the Unreal corse on udemy that I customised to take part in a combined univers of Ubik Philip K Dick's book and H2G2

The rules of the game are explaned inside the game but here they are anyways : You have to find the 3 numbers that match the requests which are 
the sum of the 3 numbers is X and the product of the 3 numbers is Y and you have to guess the numbers in no particular order.

The levle of difficulty increases until you reach all of them. 

Have fun !
